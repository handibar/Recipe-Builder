## Description

This application allows a user to select from a list of common household ingredients and will return a list of recipes containing the user’s selected ingredients.

RecipeMe is for amateur home cooks who have no idea what to make but have plenty of ingredients to spare. The application takes away the stress and time for thinking about what meal to make.

## User Story

AS AN individual without any idea what to make at home for myself,
I WANT TO see a list of recipes that contains the ingredients I already have at home,
SO THAT I can cook a meal accordingly.

When the user arrives on the homepage, they will see a list of ingredients. Upon log in, users can check the ingredients they have available in their kitchen and find recipes in our database that match those ingredients.

When they click “Create” those recipes will display. From there, a user can click on the image to see the recipe or they can “Favorite” the recipe. When a user “Favorites” a recipe, it is displayed on their profile page for future reference. 

If the user decides to delete a recipe from their profile, it will no longer be displayed.
